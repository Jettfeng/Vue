 \n});\n```\n\n```\n→ Mac address for this host: ab:42:de:13:ef:37\n```\n\n**With `iface` parameter:**\n\n```JavaScript\nmacaddress.one('awdl0', function (err, mac) {\n  console.log(\"Mac address for awdl0: %s\", mac);  \n});\n```\n\n```\n→ Mac address for awdl0: ab:cd:ef:34:12:56\n```\n\n---\n\n### `.all(callback)`\n\nRetrieves the MAC addresses for all non-internal interfaces.\n\n```JavaScript\nmacaddress.all(function (err, all) {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(all, null, 2));\n});\n```\n\n```JavaScript\n{\n  \"en0\": {\n    \"ipv6\": \"fe80::cae0:ebff:fe14:1da9\",\n    \"ipv4\": \"192.168.178.20\",\n    \"mac\": \"ab:42:de:13:ef:37\"\n  },\n  \"awdl0\": {\n    \"ipv6\": \"fe80::58b9:daff:fea9:23a9\",\n    \"mac\": \"ab:cd:ef:34:12:56\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### `.networkInterfaces()`\n\nA useful replacement of `os.networkInterfaces()`.
