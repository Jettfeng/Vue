zlib port to javascript, very fast!\n==========================================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pako.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pako)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pako.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pako)\n\n__Why pako is cool:__\n\n- Almost as fast in modern JS engines as C implementation (see benchmarks).\n- Works in browsers, you can browserify any separate component.\n- Chunking support for big blobs.\n- Results are binary equal to well known [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) (now contains ported zlib v1.2.8).\n\nThis project was done to understand how fast JS can be and is it necessary to\ndevelop native C modules for CPU-intensive tasks. Enjoy the result!\n\n\n__Famous projects, using pako:__\n\n- [browserify](http://browserify.org/) (via [browserify-zlib](https://github.com/devongovett/browserify-zlib))\n- [JSZip](http://stuk.github.io/jszip/)\n- [mincer](https://github.com/nodeca/mincer)\n- [JS-Git](https://github.com/creationix/js-git) and\n  [Tedit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tedit-development-environ/ooekdijbnbbjdfjocaiflnjgoohnblgf)\n  by [@creatronix](https://github.com/creationix)\n\n\n__Benchmarks:__\n\n```\nnode v0.10.26, 1mb sample:\n\n   deflate-dankogai x 4.73 ops/sec ±0.82% (15 runs sampled)\n   deflate-gildas x 4.58 ops/sec ±2.33% (15 runs sampled)\n   deflate-imaya x 3.22 ops/sec ±3.95% (12 runs sampled)\n ! deflate-pako x 6.99 ops/sec ±0.51% (21 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-string x 5.89 ops/sec ±0.77% (18 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-untyped x 4.39 ops/sec ±1.58% (14 runs sampled)\n * deflate-zlib x 14.71 ops/sec ±4.23% (59 runs sampled)\n   inflate-dankogai x 32.16 ops/sec ±0.13% (56 runs sampled)\n   inflate-imaya x 30.35 ops/sec ±0.92% (53 runs sampled)\n ! inflate-pako x 69.89 ops/sec ±1.46% (71 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-string x 19.22 ops/sec ±1.86% (49 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-untyped x 17.19 ops/sec ±0.85% (32 runs sampled)\n * inflate-zlib x 70.03 ops/sec ±1.64% (81 runs sampled)\n\nnode v0.11.12, 1mb sample:\n\n   deflate-dankogai x 5.60 ops/sec ±0.49% (17 runs sampled)\n   deflate-gildas x 5.06 ops/sec ±6.00% (16 runs sampled)\n   deflate-imaya x 3.52 ops/sec ±3.71% (13 runs sampled)\n ! deflate-pako x 11.52 ops/sec ±0.22% (32 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-string x 9.53 ops/sec ±1.12% (27 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-untyped x 5.44 ops/sec ±0.72% (17 runs sampled)\n * deflate-zlib x 14.05 ops/sec ±3.34% (63 runs sampled)\n   inflate-dankogai x 42.19 ops/sec ±0.09% (56 runs sampled)\n   inflate-imaya x 79.68 ops/sec ±1.07% (68 runs sampled)\n ! inflate-pako x 97.52 ops/sec ±0.83% (80 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-string x 45.19 ops/sec ±1.69% (57 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-untyped x 24.35 ops/sec ±2.59% (40 runs sampled)\n * inflate-zlib x 60.32 ops/sec ±1.36% (69 runs sampled)\n```\n\nzlib's test is partialy afferted by marshling (that make sense for inflate only).\nYou can change deflate level to 0 in benchmark source, to investigate details.\nFor deflate level 6 results can be considered as correct.\n\n__Install:__\n\nnode.js:\n\n```\nnpm install pako\n```\n\nbrowser:\n\n```\nbower install pako\n```\n\n\nExample & API\n-------------\n\nFull docs - http://nodeca.github.io/pako/\n\n```javascript\nvar pako = require('pako');\n\n// Deflate\n//\nvar input = new Uint8Array();\n//... fill input data here\nvar output = pako.deflate(input);\n\n// Inflate (simple wrapper can throw exception on broken stream)\n//\nvar compressed = new Uint8Array();\n//... fill data to uncompress here\ntry {\n  var result = pako.inflate(compressed);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.log(err);\n}\n\n//\n// Alternate interface for chunking & without exceptions\n//\n\nvar inflator = new pako.Inflate();\n\ninflator.push(chunk1, false);\ninflator.push(chunk2, false);\n...\ninflator.push(chunkN, true); // true -> last chunk\n\nif (inflator.err) {\n  console.log(inflator.msg);\n}\n\nvar output = inflator.result;\n\n```\n\nSometime you can wish to work with strings. For example, to send\nbig objects as json to server. Pako detects input data type. You can\nforce output to be string with option `{ to: 'string' }`.\n\n```javascript\nvar pako = require('pako');\n\nvar test = { my: 'super', puper: [456, 567], awesome: 'pako' };\n\nvar binaryString = pako.deflate(JSON.stringify(test), { to: 'string' });\n\n//\n// Here you can do base64 encode, make xhr requests and so on.\n//\n\nvar restored = JSON.parse(pako.inflate(binaryString, { to: 'string' }));\n```\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nPako does not contain some specific zlib functions:\n\n- __deflate__ -  methods `deflateCopy`, `deflateBound`, `deflateParams`,\n  `deflatePending`, `deflatePrime`, `deflateTune`.\n- __inflate__ - methods `inflateCopy`, `inflateMark`,\n  `inflatePrime`, `inflateGetDictionary`, `inflateSync`, `inflateSyncPoint`, `inflateUndermine`.\n- High level inflate/deflate wrappers (classes) may not support some flush\n  modes. Those should work: Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_FINISH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n- Andrey Tupitsin [@anrd83](https://github.com/andr83)\n- Vitaly Puzrin [@puzrin](https://github.com/puzrin)\n\nPersonal thanks to:\n\n- Vyacheslav Egorov ([@mraleph](https://github.com/mraleph)) for his awesome\n  tutorials about optimising JS code for v8, [IRHydra](http://mrale.ph/irhydra/)\n  tool and his advices.\n- David Duponchel ([@dduponchel](https://github.com/dduponchel)) for help with\n  testing.\n\nOriginal implementation (in C):\n\n- [zlib](http://zlib.net/) by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"vitaly","email":"vitaly@rcdesign.ru"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-03-26T15:47:59.658Z","created":"2014-02-19T16:02:05.385Z","0.0.0":"2014-02-19T16:02:05.385Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-15T17:36:20.687Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-20T02:31:52.798Z","0.2.0":"2014-04-18T05:44:58.777Z","0.2.1":"2014-05-01T18:14:04.622Z","0.2.2":"2014-06-04T07:31:28.956Z","0.2.3":"2014-06-08T20:46:47.067Z","0.2.4":"2014-07-07T05:50:16.563Z","0.2.5":"2014-07-19T10:08:28.458Z","0.2.6":"2015-03-24T01:51:57.856Z","0.2.7":"2015-06-09T19:58:14.372Z","0.2.8":"2015-09-14T12:21:28.534Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-17T09:18:02.220Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-01T14:31:14.198Z","1.0.2":"2016-07-21T20:31:28.170Z","0.2.9":"2016-07-21T20:41:41.367Z","1.0.3":"2016-07-25T19:48:45.827Z","1.0.4":"2016-12-15T00:33:47.154Z","1.0.5":"2017-03-26T15:47:59.658Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/nodeca/pako","keywords":["zlib","deflate","inflate","gzip"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/nodeca/pako.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Andrei Tuputcyn","url":"https://github.com/andr83"},{"name":"Vitaly Puzrin","url":"https://github.com/puzrin"},{"name":"Friedel Ziegelmayer","url":"https://github.com/dignifiedquire"},{"name":"Kirill Efimov","url":"https://github.com/Kirill89"},{"name":"Jean-loup Gailly"},{"name":"Mark Adler"}],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nodeca/pako/issues"},"license":"(MIT AND Zlib)","users":{"maxogden":true,"guybrush":true,"devongovett":true,"sidwood":true,"pid":true,"ivansky":true,"vlazar":true,"gudvinr":true,"flozz":true,"moimikey":true,"illuminator":true,"jhuckaby":true,"forresto":true,"monolithed":true,"mhaidarh":true,"zewish":true},"_attachments":{},"_lastModified":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 15:47:59 GMT"}
