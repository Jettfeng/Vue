Copy Webpack Plugin\n\nThis is a [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) plugin that copies individual files or entire directories to the build directory.\n\n### Getting started\n\nInstall the plugin:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev copy-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n`new CopyWebpackPlugin([patterns], options)`\n\nA pattern looks like:\n`{ from: 'source', to: 'dest' }`\n\n#### Pattern properties:\n\n| Name | Required | Default     | Details                                                 |\n|------|----------|------------ |---------------------------------------------------------|\n| `from` | Y        |             | _examples:_<br>'relative/file.txt'<br>'/absolute/file.txt'<br>'relative/dir'<br>'/absolute/dir'<br>'\\*\\*/\\*'<br>{glob:'\\*\\*/\\*', dot: true}<br><br>Globs accept [minimatch options](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) |\n| `to`   | N        | output root if `from` is file or dir<br><br>resolved glob path if `from` is glob | _examples:_<br>'relative/file.txt'<br>'/absolute/file.txt'<br>'relative/dir'<br>'/absolute/dir'<br>'relative/[name].[ext]'<br>'/absolute/[name].[ext]'<br><br>Templates are [file-loader patterns](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader) |\n| `toType` | N | **'file'** if `to` has extension or `from` is file<br><br>**'dir'** if `from` is directory, `to` has no extension or ends in '/'<br><br>**'template'** if `to` contains [a template pattern](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader) | |\n| `context` | N | compiler.options.context | A path that determines how to interpret the `from` path |\n| `flatten` | N | false | Removes all directory references and only copies file names<br><br>If files have the same name, the result is non-deterministic |\n| `ignore` | N | [] | Additional globs to ignore for this pattern |\n| `transform` | N | function(content, path) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return content;<br>} | Function that modifies file contents before writing to webpack |\n| `force` | N | false | Overwrites files already in compilation.assets (usually added by other plugins) |\n\n#### Available options:\n\n| Name | Default | Details |\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| `ignore` | [] | Array of globs to ignore (applied to `from`) |\n| `copyUnmodified` | false | Copies files, regardless of modification when using watch or webpack-dev-server. All files are copied on first build, regardless of this option. |\n| `debug` | **'warning'** | _options:_<br>**'warning'** - only warnings<br>**'info'** or true - file location and read info<br>**'debug'** - very detailed debugging info\n\n### Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    context: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),\n    devServer: {\n        // This is required for older versions of webpack-dev-server\n        // if you use absolute 'to' paths.

It’ll watch your source files for changes and when changes are made the bundle will be recompiled. **This modified bundle is served from memory at the relative path specified in publicPath (see API)**. It will not be written to your configured output directory.\n\nIf you must have webpack-dev-server write to your output directory, you can force it with the [write-file-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin).\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"kevlened","email":"boyettel@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-03-27T19:32:46.330Z","created":"2015-10-27T02:33:59.354Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-27T02:33:59.354Z","0.2.0":"2015-10-29T02:52:15.343Z","0.3.0":"2015-11-27T20:31:34.174Z","0.3.1":"2015-11-27T20:36:09.886Z","0.3.2":"2015-11-28T01:41:53.949Z","0.3.3":"2015-11-28T01:51:49.809Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-24T21:29:45.189Z","1.1.0":"2016-01-26T06:32:57.890Z","1.1.1":"2016-01-26T06:42:24.598Z","2.0.0":"2016-04-15T04:00:46.595Z","2.0.1":"2016-04-15T05:24:20.521Z","2.1.0":"2016-04-16T20:27:04.617Z","2.1.1":"2016-04-16T21:14:18.700Z","2.1.2":"2016-04-23T19:32:51.501Z","2.1.3":"2016-04-23T19:36:06.973Z","2.1.4":"2016-05-13T06:37:24.860Z","2.1.5":"2016-05-13T15:39:29.029Z","2.1.6":"2016-05-14T18:55:35.086Z","3.0.0":"2016-05-15T00:29:14.473Z","3.0.1":"2016-05-30T05:01:24.311Z","4.0.0":"2016-10-23T19:51:07.449Z","4.0.1":"2016-11-14T01:10:38.712Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin","keywords":["webpack","plugin","transfer","move","copy"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Len Boyette"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"corintho":true,"r3nya":true,"rbartoli":true,"zoey1990":true,"j3manoto":true,"igsys":true,"zwxajh":true,"antanst":true,"huangxinxin":true,"sdt":true,"fadihania":true,"ghostcode521":true,"chrisz-b612":true,"gusgarcia":true,"monolithed":true,"aristov":true,"langri-sha":true,"klimnikita":true,"shanewholloway":true,"manny":true,"yedaodao":true,"dheerajvs":true,"shakakira":true,"dbuggerx":true,"podlebar":true,"uptonking":true,"serge-nikitin":true,"monkeykode":true,"creager":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"58d968de-a069\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 19:32:46 GMT"}
